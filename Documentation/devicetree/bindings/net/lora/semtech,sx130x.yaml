description: |
  Semtech LoRa concentrator SX130x digital baseband chip is capable of
  demodulating LoRa signals on 8 channels simultaneously.

  It is typically paired with two SX125x IQ radios controlled over an
  SPI directly from the concentrator.

  The concentrator itself is controlled over SPI.

      Consisting of maximum 16 entries, each entry having the following format;
      First byte is signed power in dBm measured at the rf connector.
      Second byte is unsigned value for DIGITAL gain.
      Third byte is unsigned value for PA gain, 2 bits only.
      Fourth byte is unsigned value for DAC gain, 2 bits only.
      Fifth byte is unsigned value for MIXER gain, 4 bits only.
